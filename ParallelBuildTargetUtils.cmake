# /ParallelBuildTargetUtils.cmake
#
# Utility functions for making "parallel" builds of targets with different
# compiler options.
#
# psq_setup_mirrored_build_target takes a pre-existing TARGET and creates
# a new "mirrored" build target with the suffix SUFFIX and
# with CXX_FLAGS and CFLAGS appended to the already-set CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and
# CMAKE_C_FLAGS. It will not set up any of its dependencies or link libraries.
# EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL will be set on the target.
#
# psq_wire_mirrored_build_target_dependencies takes a pre-existing TARGET
# and will, for a SUFFIX, find the created mirrored build target using that
# suffix and wire its dependencies up.
#
# psq_create_mirrored_build_target will perform both of these steps together.
